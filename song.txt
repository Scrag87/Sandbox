This one's for you Mrs McGonagall!

My love for you is like the most super sprout,
Your face reminds me of smelly aardvarks,
Together, we are like salad and ketchup.

Oh darling Carla,
My super sprout,
My smelly carrot,
The perfect companion to my salad soul.

Strawberries are red,
Violets are blue,
I like pretty girls,
But not as much as I love swinging with you!
