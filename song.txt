This one's for you Mrs McGonagall!

My love for you is like the most super sprout,
Your face reminds me of smelly aardvarks,
Together, we are like salad and ketchup.

Oh darling Carla,
My super sprout,
My smelly carrot,
The perfect companion to my salad soul.

Strawberries are red,
Violets are blue,
I like pretty girls,
But not as much as I love swinging with you!

Oh darling Carla,

Strawberries are red,
Violets are blue,
I like pretty girls,
But not as much as I love swinging with you!

Oh darling Carla,
Your knees are like amusing watches on a winter day,
You're like the most porky academic to ever walk Mars.

Your smelly aardvark face,
Your ketchup soul,
Your amusing knees,
Your porky academic being...

How could I look at another when our super sprout love is so strong?

I love you Mrs McGonagall!
